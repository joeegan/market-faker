The following table has been coded:

![Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeegan/market-faker/master/animation.gif)

The streaming data is mock - see README.md for a brief overview of the market-faker.

Use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) to look up any JavaScript documentation.
Refrain from using any libs.

Challenges:

1. How would you add a range column which denotes the difference between the high and low, situated next to Low
2. How would you sort by the range using the snapshot data only
3. We have been asked to reduce the amount of prices we are showing in the sparkline, how could you do that?
4. Explore approaches to sorting by range using streamed data

Questions:
1. How would make sure that grid remained performant when the browser is resized?
2. There's been a request for a pie chart denoting highest ranges, how would you go about building this?
3. If market faker was real what would be the best way to consume it?
4. How could you measure the performance of the grid?
